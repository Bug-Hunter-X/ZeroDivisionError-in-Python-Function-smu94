This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero, a mathematically undefined operation. The solution uses a `try-except` block to gracefully handle this exception and prevent program crashes.
